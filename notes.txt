For Go, maybe create simple functions and such, and create a Go file that will
create structs and methods and interface with the simplified NEAT interface.
This method may be necessary because I'm not sure if ABI supports structs. Even
so Go support will be on the back-burner until much later, after Python and
Rust support has been added.
